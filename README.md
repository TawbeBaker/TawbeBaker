## 🤖 AI, Coding & GitHub Copilot

One of my biggest passions is **AI-assisted development**.  
I’m a big **AI enthusiast**, always learning, testing, and building with tools like  
**GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Replit AI, Windsurf, Cursor, Ollama, n8n, ComfyUI**, and many more.  

### 🔧 How I use AI
- 🛠️ **To build & experiment** — generating code, automating workflows, and prototyping projects.  
- 📚 **To learn & discover** — using AI as a tutor to explore coding concepts, frameworks, and problem-solving strategies.  

### 🧰 Tools & Platforms I’ve explored
- **AI assistants**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok  
- **Coding copilots**: GitHub Copilot, Replit AI, Windsurf, Cursor  
- **Local & open-source AI**: Ollama, DeepSeek, GPT-OSS, Alpaca, UNSLOTH  
- **Automation & workflows**: n8n, Docker, Hostinger AI  
- **Creative AI**: Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image, Image-to-Video, Text-to-Video, ComfyUI, Flux, WAN  
- **Libraries & frameworks**: PyTorch, pandas, numpy  

Some of these I’ve only tried briefly, while others I’ve used more extensively.
